# metawidget-demo
Demo of metawidget functionality in simple Angular app context.

This is a simple single-page demo, with a very ugly form that obtains user-entered personal information, and spits it back out to console in a none-too-humorous fashion.

The demo implements an editable table for the nested property array of 'childen' information.
